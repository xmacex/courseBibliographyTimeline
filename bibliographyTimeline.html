      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <h3>About data</h3>
      <p>References to following references is not included:
	<ul>
	  <li>Optional readings from the syllabus. Some of these items do get referenced by the students.</li>
	  <li>Academic publications from outside the syllabus</li>
	  <li>Online sources are not included (see prev.). These include a wide range of things, including Obama's statements on Whitehouse.gov, Facebook's policy documents, Wikipedia, news stories from BusinessInsider, Danish media, Google, Apple and Facebook statements, Zuckerberg's status posts, lecture slides etc.</li>
	  <li>Chapters of books are not separated, because referencing which the sudents reference is a bit of a drag. This impacts especially Connolly+Hoar 2013 and DeNardis 2014.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>Further, the data was typed in from a 100 or so PDF
	documents, with inconsistent references, so human errors
	possibly exist from just the typing process.
      </p>
      <h3>Data model</h3>
      <p>The underlying datamodel is rather confused at the moment</p>
