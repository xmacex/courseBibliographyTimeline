      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <h3>About data</h3>
      <p>References to following references is not included:
	<ul>
	  <li>Optional readings from the syllabus. Some of these items do get referenced by the students.</li>
	  <li>Academic publications from outside the syllabus</li>
	  <li>Online sources are not included (see prev.). These include a wide range of things, including Obama's statements on Whitehouse.gov, Facebook's policy documents, Wikipedia, news stories from BusinessInsider, Danish media, Google, Apple and Facebook statements, Zuckerberg's status posts, lecture slides etc.</li>
	  <li>Chapters of books are not separated, because checking which chapter the students reference is too much of a drag for me right now. This impacts especially Connolly+Hoar 2013 and DeNardis 2014.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>Further, the data was typed in from a 100 or so PDF
	documents, with inconsistent references, so human errors
	possibly exist from just the typing process.
      </p>
      <h3>Data model</h3>
      <p>The underlying datamodel is rather confused at the moment,
	with an intermediate bipartite graph, with assignments as keys
	for joining the two lists.</p>
      <p>The data model would allow further analysis, and could easily
	be extended to include further data. Proportion of mandatory
	readings vs. optional readings vs. outside references comes to
	mind, at least (requiring more work inputing data from the
	submissions).
      </p>
      <h3>User interface</h3>
      <p>The source circles overlap, which might make some of the
	items unavailable for interaction if the canvas
	(<em>window.innerWidth</em>) is not wide enought. This could be
	remedied with re-ordering the SVG elements.
