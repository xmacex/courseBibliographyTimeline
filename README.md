# A little d3.js project for seeing how students referenced course literature

I was a teaching assistant for a course, and this project maps out visually how the 70 or so students referenced the mandatory readings in their four assignments. See the HTML documents for more description.

Pretty horrible codewide, I was sketching while I went along. A round or two of refactoring would be welcome :)
